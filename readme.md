# Todo App with Pomodoro Timers (GJS + GTK4)

A simple Todo application built with GNOME JavaScript (GJS) and GTK4, featuring per-task Pomodoro-style timers and a stack-based UI to switch between active and completed tasks.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Input new todo items through an entry field.
- **Active & Completed Views**: Switch between "Todos" (active tasks) and "Completed" via a top-bar `Gtk.StackSwitcher`.
- **Per-Task Pomodoro Timer**:

  - Circular timer visualization using `Gtk.DrawingArea` and Cairo.
  - Default 25-minute countdown.
  - Start/Pause, Reset controls per task.
  - Automatic stop and visual update when time elapses.

- **Complete/Un-complete**:

  - `Gtk.CheckButton` toggles completion state.
  - Moving tasks between active and completed lists disables/enables timer controls.

- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks (and stop timers if running) with a delete button.
- **Theme-Adaptive UI**: Timer arc and text colors adapt to light/dark themes via style context.
- **Scrollable Lists**: Both active and completed lists scroll independently.

## Prerequisites

- **GNOME JavaScript (GJS)**: Ensure `gjs` is installed.
- **GTK4 development files**: For runtime, ensure GTK4 libraries are present.
- **GLib/GIO**: Available by default on GNOME-based systems.
- **Ubuntu 24.04 or similar Linux**: Tested on Ubuntu 24.04.

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install gjs libgtk-4-dev
dpkg -l | grep gjs
```

Ensure that `gjs` and GTK4 are properly installed before running the app.

## Installation

1. **Clone or copy** the repository or script:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd <repo-directory>
   ```

   Or simply place `main.js` in a folder.

2. **Make executable**:

   ```bash
   chmod +x main.js
   ```

3. (Optional) **Add a `.desktop` file** if you want to integrate into GNOME menu:

   - Create a file `com.example.TodoPomodoroApp.desktop` in `~/.local/share/applications/` with content:

     ```ini
     [Desktop Entry]
     Name=Todo Pomodoro App
     Comment=Todo list with Pomodoro timers
     Exec=/path/to/main.js
     Icon=utilities-terminal
     Terminal=false
     Type=Application
     Categories=Utility;
     ```

   - Adjust `Exec=` path to the absolute path of `main.js`. Choose an appropriate icon or leave default.

## Usage

1. **Run the app**:

   ```bash
   ./main.js
   ```

2. **Add a Task**:

   - In the "Todos" view (default), type a task in the entry field and press **Enter** or click **âž• Add Task**.

3. **Start Pomodoro Timer**:

   - For an active task, click **Start** next to its circular clock. The arc and time text update each second.
   - Click **Pause** to pause; **Start** to resume.
   - Click **Reset** to reset to 25:00.

4. **Complete a Task**:

   - Click the checkbox next to the task label. This stops and resets the timer, disables Start/Reset buttons, and moves the task to the "Completed" view.
   - To view completed tasks, click **Completed** in the top StackSwitcher.
   - Uncheck a completed task to move it back to "Todos" (timer resets and controls re-enable).

5. **Delete a Task**:

   - Click the ðŸ—‘ button next to a task (in either view). This stops any running timer and removes the task.

6. **Switching Views**:

   - Use the top-bar buttons: **Todos** and **Completed** to toggle between active and completed lists.

## Customization

- **Pomodoro Duration**:

  - Default duration is 25 minutes (`25 * 60` in seconds). To change, modify `POMODORO_DURATION` in `main.js`.

- **Clock Size & Font**:

  - Adjust `CLOCK_SIZE` (pixel width/height) in `main.js` for larger/smaller circles.
  - In the drawing function, modify Pango font description (e.g., `"12"`) for readability.

- **Styling Completed Tasks**:

  - Apply CSS classes via `Gtk.CssProvider` to dim or strikethrough labels in completed view. For example:

    ```js
    checkButton.get_style_context().add_class("completed-task");
    ```

  - In code, when toggling completion, add/remove a CSS class on the row or label; load a CSS provider at startup.

- **Notifications**:

  - On timer completion, you can show a `Gtk.MessageDialog` or use `Gio.Application.send_notification` (requires proper application registration and desktop file).

- **Persistent Storage**:

  - Save tasks (and optionally paused timer states) to a file on disk (e.g., JSON) on app exit, and reload on startup using `GLib.File` or standard JS file I/O in GJS.

- **Break Cycles**:

  - Extend timer logic to auto-start a short break after work interval, track cycles per task or globally. Requires a state machine per task.

- **Flatpak Packaging**:

  - Create a Flatpak manifest to sandbox and distribute via Flathub. Use `org.gnome.Sdk` runtime and install GJS if needed.

## Troubleshooting

- **`Error: Tried to construct an object without a GType`**:

  - Ensure you are not subclassing `Gtk.Application` in GJS. The provided code instantiates `Gtk.Application` and connects signals appropriately.

- **GTK Version Ambiguity**:

  - If warnings about requiring Gtk but multiple versions exist, ensure GJS picks GTK4 by adding:

    ```js
    imports.gi.versions.Gtk = "4.0";
    ```

    before importing.

- **Permissions**:

  - If `./main.js` fails with permission denied, verify `chmod +x main.js`.

- **Theme Colors**:

  - If timer arc/text is not visible in a particular theme, adjust color extraction or define explicit colors in drawing code.

## Development & Contribution

- Feel free to fork and extend. Key areas:

  - Implement persistence
  - Add customizable durations per task
  - Enhance UI/UX with CSS
  - Integrate notifications
  - Internationalization (i18n) using gettext in GJS

- For bug reports or feature requests, open an issue in the repository.
